* Testing ghmain (While testing the senser, the temperature reading were negative. I think is has to do with the voltage error I had while testing it on Vlad fixer before putting it on my PI).

### Week 4 (October 2, 2017)

* Began to research parts and ordering them. 
* Waiting for the parts to come in to start filming the unboxing for the build video in the coming weeks. 
* Attempted to blink the LED on the part crib PI but failed as it couldn't connect and is troubleshooting to see if it the PI or the computer. PI number 143 and 149 has been tested so far. 
* Received the PCB from the prototype lab.

### Week 3 (September 25, 2017)

* Started on the [Project Budget](https://github.com/patng2007/VoiceRecognition/blob/master/documentation/CENG317%20Budget.xlsx).
* Discussion about next semester group for Computer Systems Project (CENG355).
* Switched to markdown (md) instead of index.html as the template wasn't displaying properly when loading the site. 

### Week 2 (September 18, 2017)

* Learned how to solder through videos.
* Emailed the prototype lab the Gerber files for the PCB.
* Started on the [MSProject Gantt Chart](https://github.com/patng2007/VoiceRecognition/blob/master/documentation/Project_Schedule.pdf).

### Week 1 (September 11, 2017)

* Tech Quiz about Microprocessers/Toolkit items.
* Created GitHub account and setup a repository for the project.
* Created patng2007.github.io/VoiceRecognition page to blog.
* Started on the [Project Proposal](https://github.com/patng2007/VoiceRecognition/blob/master/documentation/ProposalContentStudentNameRev02.xlsx) after choosing a sensor to work with.
