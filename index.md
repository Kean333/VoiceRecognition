### Week 10 (January 8, 2017)
* Progress Report

Dues to the strike that has occurred, my project schedule has been changed. In the past couple of weeks, I have manage to create my video which include unboxing, assembling and functionality of my project. Even through my project did not require the PCB, I had it built and tested to see if I get data and can be used in future project. 

As of today (January 8th 2018) I have manage to get my sensor working with my raspberry PI to read speech input and output the result of the speech. During this process, I had ran into issue with my sound card as I couldn’t get the output on the sound card so I decide to use the PI 3.5mm jack to connect my speaker in the meantime. Will continue to modify to get it working on the sound card. 

With the issue that had occurred on my sound card , it didn’t require me to spend more funds to get a new one as I think I just need to change some setting on my PI. So my financial fund has not changed for this project. 
 
Only objective that I have left for this project is creating the build instruction so other users can easily follow it and build it for themselves without feeling overwhelm of information that they have to research to get it working.

* Script

Introduction - Welcome to Project Teemo created by Patrick. (Video - Blank screen with writing)

Parts- Here are the parts that I ordered from Amazon to build this project (Video - Showing the parts)

Parts Assembly - Start with connecting the usb adapter to one of the usb slot on the PI and plug in the speaker to the PI 3.5mm input and microphone to the 3.5mm input on the adapter. (Video - Putting the parts together like the script says)

Power up - Power up the PI and Setup the PI (Video - Plugging in the PI)

Functionality – Weather, Time, Simple Mathematics, Jokes (Video - Blank screen with writing)

* Testing ghmain (While testing the senser, the temperature reading were negative. I think is has to do with the voltage error I had while testing it on Vlad fixer before putting it on my PI).

* Testing BME280 (Also tried to use i2cdetect to see if the sensor were being detected)

### Week 6 (November 27, 2017)

* Retreived the missing modules for the PCB
* Finish soldering PCB
* Updating the blog to current date
* Filming unboxing part of the video

### Strike (October 16 - November 20)

* (November 20th) Raspberry PI was imaged
* Configured the PI to be able to remote into it from a PC/Laptop instead of using an HDMI connection

### Week 5 (October 16, 2017)

* Started to solder the PCB that is dues on week 7. 
* Received all the parts that was ordered.

### Reading Day (October 9, 2017)

* No Class. 
* Updated the blog to the current week (October 12, 2017).

### Week 4 (October 2, 2017)

* Began to research parts and ordering them. 
* Waiting for the parts to come in to start filming the unboxing for the build video in the coming weeks. 
* Attempted to blink the LED on the part crib PI but failed as it couldn't connect and is troubleshooting to see if it the PI or the computer. PI number 143 and 149 has been tested so far. 
* Received the PCB from the prototype lab.

### Week 3 (September 25, 2017)

* Started on the [Project Budget](https://github.com/patng2007/VoiceRecognition/blob/master/documentation/CENG317%20Budget.xlsx).
* Discussion about next semester group for Computer Systems Project (CENG355).
* Switched to markdown (md) instead of index.html as the template wasn't displaying properly when loading the site. 

### Week 2 (September 18, 2017)

* Learned how to solder through videos.
* Emailed the prototype lab the Gerber files for the PCB.
* Started on the [MSProject Gantt Chart](https://github.com/patng2007/VoiceRecognition/blob/master/documentation/Project_Schedule.pdf).

### Week 1 (September 11, 2017)

* Tech Quiz about Microprocessers/Toolkit items.
* Created GitHub account and setup a repository for the project.
* Created patng2007.github.io/VoiceRecognition page to blog.
* Started on the [Project Proposal](https://github.com/patng2007/VoiceRecognition/blob/master/documentation/ProposalContentStudentNameRev02.xlsx) after choosing a sensor to work with.
